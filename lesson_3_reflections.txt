Reflect: Using a remote repository
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If more there is more than one local repository (e.g. a number of contributors or a number of client machines pushing info)
If the power is about to go or local machine is about to fry :-)

Reflect: Manual vs. automatic pull
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I want to know what is on my local machine and manually pulling changes helps in this regard rather than changes appearing behind my back.
Other people may push changes and I only want these after I inspect them.

Reflect: Forks, Clones, and Branches
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A clone is an exact copy as downloaded from a remote server to my local client. 
A fork is a copy of a git hub repository. A fork is located on the git hub server.
A branch is where changes are made on the local machine but the original stream is also kept.
I would use a fork to create a copy of someone else's git hub repository at the very beginning where the result would end up in my own git hub account.
I would perform a clone at the beginning after doing a fork
I would use a branch when created a new stream of changes on my local machine after earlier forking and cloning the repository.
