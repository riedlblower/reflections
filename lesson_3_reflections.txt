Reflect: Using a remote repository
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If more there is more than one local repository (e.g. a number of contributors or a number of client machines pushing info)
If the power is about to go or local machine is about to fry :-)

Reflect: Manual vs. automatic pull
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I want to know what is on my local machine and manually pulling changes helps in this regard rather than changes appearing behind my back.
Other people may push changes and I only want these after I inspect them.
